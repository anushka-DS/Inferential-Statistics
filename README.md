# Inferential-Statistics


Inferential Statistics make predictions about a population based on a sample of data taken from that population. 

Inferential statistics takes data from a sample and makes inferences about the larger population from which the sample was drawn. Because the goal of inferential statistics is to draw conclusions from a sample and generalize them to a population, we need to have confidence that our sample accurately reflects the population. This requirement affects our process. At a broad level, we must do the following:

1. Define the population we are studying.
2. Draw a representative sample from that population.
3. Use analyses that incorporate the sampling error.


**Inferential vs Descriptive analysis**

	Descriptive Statistics	vs Inferential Statistics
1.	DS gives information about raw data which describes the data in some manner.	IS makes inference about population using data drawn from the population.
2.	DS helps in organizing, analyzing and to present data in a meaningful manner.	IS allows us to compare data, make hypothesis and predictions.
3.	DS is used to describe a situation.	IS is used to explain the chance of occurrence of an event.
4.	DS explain already known data and limited to a sample or population having small size.	IS attempts to reach the conclusion about the population.
5.	DS can be achieved with the help of charts, graphs, tables etc.	IS can be achieved by probability.

# Probability and Statistics cheatsheets for Stanford's CME 106
## Goal
This repository aims at summing up in the same place all the important notions that are covered in Stanford's CME 106 Probability and Statistics for Engineers course. It includes a **2-page cheatsheet** dedicated to **Probability** as well as another **2-page cheasheet** to **Statistics**, so that you can review the material of the class in a concise format!
